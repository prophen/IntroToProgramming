Exercise 7

Given the following code...

```
x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}
```

What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?
____

The `x` key in `my_hash` is a symbol. In `my_hash2` the `x` key is a variable which holds the string "hi there"
