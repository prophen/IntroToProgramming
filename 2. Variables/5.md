Look at the following programs...

```
x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x
```
and...

```
y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x
```
What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?
___

In the first program `x` will print `3`. In the second program there is an error because `x` is undefined within the scope it is being called.
